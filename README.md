Ankaref Internship Projects

This repository contains the projects I developed during my mandatory summer internship at Ankaref. Each project was carefully selected to enhance my skills and provide a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development processes.

Project Overview

Task 1 & Task 2

In these initial projects, I focused solely on Java, gaining practical experience in object-oriented programming, error handling, and data manipulation.

Task 3

I advanced to managing data flows using Java's Stream API, performing more complex operations and deepening my understanding of functional programming.

Task 4

This phase involved using Java alongside Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to implement CRUD operations. Additionally, I implemented authentication mechanisms using JWT tokens, marking my first foray into secure web development.

Task 5

The final project completed my full-stack development journey. I built the backend using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL and developed the frontend with Angular and TypeScript. This project involved creating an event tracking application, connecting backend and frontend components, and performing thorough testing.
