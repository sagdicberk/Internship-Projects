# Ankaref Internship Projects

This repository showcases the projects I developed during my mandatory summer internship at Ankaref. Each project was selected to enhance my technical skills and provide a well-rounded understanding of full-stack development.

## Project Overview

### Task 1 & Task 2
In the first two projects, I focused on core Java, gaining hands-on experience in object-oriented programming (OOP), error handling, and data manipulation.

### Task 3
I progressed to managing data flows using Java's Stream API, working on more complex operations and expanding my knowledge of functional programming principles.

### Task 4
This stage involved combining Java with Spring Boot and PostgreSQL to implement CRUD operations. I also introduced JWT-based authentication, marking my entry into secure web development.

### Task 5
In the final project, I completed my full-stack development experience. I built a backend using Spring Boot and PostgreSQL, and developed a frontend using Angular and TypeScript. The project focused on creating an event tracking application, ensuring seamless integration between the backend and frontend, and conducting extensive testing.
